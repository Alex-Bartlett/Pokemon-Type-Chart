# Pokemon-Type-Chart
Gen 8 Pokémon type chart represented as a 2D array. Can be used for making Pokémon type-related programs, or turning into a complete type chart.

It is written in JavaScript, but it's just an array so you can repurpose it to any language you wish.

## Order
The order is specified in the typeOrder array, and is designed to be referenced alongside the typeTable.
The table takes the following order:
- Normal
- Fire
- Water
- Grass
- Electric
- Ice
- Fighting
- Poison
- Ground
- Flying
- Psychic
- Bug
- Rock
- Ghost
- Dragon
- Dark
- Steel
- Fairy
